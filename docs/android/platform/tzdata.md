# Time Zone Data (tzdata)
The Time Zone Data module updates daylight saving time (DST) and time zones on Android devices, standardizing both the data (which can change frequently in response to religious, political, and geopolitical reasons) and the update mechanism across the ecosystem. For more details on Time Zone Data, see Time Zone Rules.
