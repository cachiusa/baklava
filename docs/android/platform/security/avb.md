# Android Verified Boot 2.0
Android 8.0 and higher includes a reference implementation of Verified Boot called Android Verified Boot (AVB) or Verified Boot 2.0.

For devices below Android 8.0, see [dm-verity](./dm-verity)

AVB works with Project Treble architecture, which separates the Android framework from the underlying vendor implementation.

AVB's key features include delegating updates for different partitions, a common footer format for signing partitions, and protection from attackers rolling back to a vulnerable version of Android (anti-rollback).
