There are altogether three build systems used in Android:
* The legacy Make-based build system that is controlled by files called
  `Android.mk`.
* Soong, which is controlled by files called `Android.bp`. (current)
* The upcoming Bazel-based build system that is controlled by files called
  `BUILD.bazel`.
