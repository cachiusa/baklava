# Project Treble
Project Treble is all about standardizing the base of Android; i.e. it's about standardizing the APIs that allow the Android framework to communicate with hardware components.

For vendors, they can quickly adapt their HALs to newer Android releases

For custom ROM, developers can make their ROM available to many devices without effort

Hardware abstraction layers (HALs) are seperated from Android Frameworks. These are now stored in vendor/

Available on Android 8.0 or later
