# Xiaomi Find Device
Find Device is a built-in function in Xiaomi smartphones and tablets that allows users to locate and track their lost devices.

Similar to FRP, it also stores persistent data in `persist` partition, particularly in `<persist mount point>/fdsd`

Inside, you will find the following files:
- `st`: Find Device info, JSON format
- `tp`: ?
